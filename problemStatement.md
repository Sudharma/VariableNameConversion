#Coding Exercise: Conversion of Variable Names

1. Assume we have several different variables, with different naming schemes

(e.g. “someVariableName”, “SOME_VARIABLE_NAME”, “some­variable­name”).

2. All variable names will consist of several words (ascii letters only plus optional delimiters,

case is only significant within a given format).

3. For any given variable, you know in advance which format it has.

Design a generic and extendable solution for converting one known format to another (a scenario

where this could be needed is an automated refactoring from e.g. a local variable to a constant).

Note that you are responsible for converting variable names only, so you are dealing with a

specific variable name at a time.

Implement this solution for at least one format.

Write unit tests as needed.

You may use open source Java libraries, as long as you don’t use a pre­existing solution for this

exact problem (but you do get bonus points for pointing to one).

Please submit a complete solution with instructions how to use it.
